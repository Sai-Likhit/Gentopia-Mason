ABSTRACT
Network traffic refers to the amount of data being sent and received over the internet or any system
that connects computers. Analyzing and understanding network traffic is vital for improving network
security and management. However, the analysis of network traffic is challenging due to the diverse
nature of data packets, which often feature heterogeneous headers and encrypted payloads lacking
semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few studies have adopted pre-training techniques
based on the Transformer encoder or decoder to learn the representations from massive traffic data.
However, these methods typically excel in traffic understanding (classification) or traffic generation
tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens , a foundation model for network traffic that leverages the
T5 architecture to learn the pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the
strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global information while preserving
the generative ability, our model can better learn the representations from raw data. To further
enhance pre-training effectiveness, we design a novel loss that combines three distinct tasks: Masked
Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous Traffic Prediction (HTP).
Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms
the baselines in most downstream tasks related to both traffic understanding and generation. Notably,
it also requires much less labeled data for fine-tuning compared to current methods.
1 Introduction
In the realm of computer networking, network traffic is defined as the flow of data, transmitted in the form of packets
between interconnected computers or systems. Typically, a packet consists of two parts: the header and the payload. The
header provides essential information regarding the packet like IP address and payload length, while the payload contains
the actual data, which may be encrypted. Given the critical role of network traffic, analyzing this data is crucial to ensure
high network security, offer high-quality network services, and facilitate effective network management. However,
analyzing network traffic poses a big challenge due to the complex characteristics of network traffic, encompassing
both ciphertext and plaintext.
Over the past decades, many approaches have been developed for network traffic analysis. Early works [ 36,1,28,42]
mainly utilized statistical methods, heavily dependent on manually crafted features. To address this issue, some studies
have employed deep learning methods [ 34,21,23,39] to extract complicated features from raw data. While these
approaches have shown impressive results in specific tasks, they often require extensive labeled data and struggle
with generalization to novel tasks. Consequently, few recent works have explored pre-training techniques to learn the
latent representations from large-scale unlabeled traffic data. For instance, some works have introduced BERT-based
models [ 8,19] to learn the pre-trained representations, subsequently applied to traffic understanding (classification) in
downstream tasks. Despite their effectiveness in traffic classification, these models lack generative capabilities due toarXiv:2402.03646v2  [cs.LG]  9 Feb 2024Lens : A F OUNDATION MODEL FOR NETWORK TRAFFIC
